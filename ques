**Exercise 4: Implement a Clock App**

Create a clock app using React. This will help you understand how to use React Hooks (such as `useState`
and `useEffect`) to manage state and update the DOM dynamically.

* Requirements:
        + Create a new React project using `create-react-app`.
        + Create a `Clock` component that displays the current time.
        + Use the `useState` hook to store the current time in state.
        + Use the `useEffect` hook to set an interval to update the clock every second.
        + Handle edge cases such as when the app is restarted.

**Exercise 5: Build a Simple Navigation Menu**

Create a simple navigation menu using React. This will help you understand how to use React Hooks (such
as `useState` and `useCallback`) to manage state and handle event listeners.

* Requirements:
        + Create a new React project using `create-react-app`.
        + Create a `NavMenu` component that renders a simple navigation menu.
        + Use the `useState` hook to store the active menu item in state.
        + Add event listeners to navigate between menu items.
        + Handle edge cases such as when the user clicks on an inactive menu item.
