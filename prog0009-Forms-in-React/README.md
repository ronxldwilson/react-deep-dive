#Create a simple form using React. This will help you understand how to handle form input data, validate
user input, and submit forms using React Hooks (such as `useState` and `useCallback`).

* Requirements:
        + Create a new React project using `create-react-app`.
        + Create a `Form` component that renders a simple text input field.
        + Use the `useState` hook to store the form input data in state.
        + Add validation logic to ensure that the form input is not empty.
