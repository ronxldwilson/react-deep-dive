Create a simple counter app using React. This will help you understand how to use React Hooks (such as
`useState`) to manage state and how to handle event listeners.

* Requirements:
        + Create a new React project using `create-react-app`.
        + Create a `Counter` component that displays a counter value.
        + Use the `useState` hook to store the counter value in state.
        + Add functionality to increment and decrement the counter value when buttons are clicked.
        + Handle edge cases such as when the counter value is reset.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
